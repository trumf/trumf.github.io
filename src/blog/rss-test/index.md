# This is a test of the RSS feed

This is some test body content to verify that the RSS feed is working correctly after we fixed the plugin installation issues.

If you can see this post in your RSS reader, then everything is working as expected!

The RSS feed should be available at: [rosenqvist.design/feed.xml](https://rosenqvist.design/feed.xml)

## Test Content

Here's some additional content to make sure the feed has enough text to work with:

- This is a bullet point
- Another test item
- Testing RSS functionality

This post should appear in both the blog index and the RSS feed once everything is working correctly.
