        <p>
          I spent five years at Volvo Cars leading the development of the EX90
          and Polestar 3, defining user and business value for future
          features, and overseeing UX and UI design for a range of systems and
          features. As design manager, I also established design visions and
          processes to improve our work.
        </p>
        <p>The EX90 and Polestar 3 show some of these efforts.</p>

      </div>

      <p>
        An area where I contributed is the welcome screen that provides
        quick controls and common actions. As the car starts, the welcome
        screen updates to provide important information and contextual
        access to navigation, media, phone, and controls.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is also a special contextual bar that suggests relevant
        information based on the vehicle's state, such as parked or driving,
        and helps provide convenient functions without overwhelming the
        user. The interface will improve over time and become smarter based
        on usage patterns.

        <p>
          As Designer Manager one of my responsibilities was the interface for
          assisted and unassisted driving.
        </p>
        <p>
          The EX90 features a driving mode awareness system that helps
          visualise what the sensors see around the car and updates the screen
          with relevant information and actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The EX90 will eventually offer unsupervised autonomous driving under
          certain conditions, allowing the driver to delegate the driving
          task. The user interface is designed to provide a safe and
          contextual experience that will improve over time.

          I helped develop Volvo's driver understanding system that monitors
          attention levels and intervenes to maintain safety if necessary.
          Using advanced eye gaze detection and two cameras, the system can
          identify when the driver is drowsy, distracted, or intoxicated and
          takes action to prevent accidents. This system will work with
          exterior sensing to improve safety and eventually enable autonomous
          driving.

      <p>
        I played a part in the development of an interior radar system that
        covers the entire cabin to prevent children or pets from being left
        behind.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system, which detects movement and breathing at a sub-millimeter
        scale, will remind the driver to check the interior when locking the
        car. It's also connected to the in-car climate system, which will be
        on whenever someone is in the car, to provide comfort and
        potentially reduce the risk of hypothermia or heatstroke. The system
        will be enhanced over time and may be linked to the Volvo Cars app
        in the future
