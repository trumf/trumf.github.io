            <p>Lately, I've been writing more code both at work and on my own projects. It got me thinking—maybe I
                should
                understand
                the design engineer role better. </p>
            <p>A design engineer bridges design and engineering. They can design user interfaces and have the technical
                skills
                to
                code them. They often make prototypes in code, contribute to design systems, and take projects from
                concept
                to
                production, which is why I'm interested in them.</p>

            <h2>Why Do Most Design Engineers Come from an Engineering Background?</h2>
            <p>One thing that struck me when reading about the role is that most design engineers come from a developer
                background,
                particularly frontend or web development. Many of the people in <a
                    href="https://maggieappleton.com/design-engineers">Maggie Appleton's "collection of Design
                    Engineers"</a> seem to come from an engineering background. Design
                engineers often start by writing software and then transition into design. It's pretty rare to see
                someone
                move
                into
                it from a pure design background.</p>
            <p>As someone who comes from a design background, I think it is harder to move from design into a design
                engineering
                role than vice versa. I will lay out my position here and explain the hurdles you might face as a
                designer.

            <h2>Learning to Code Isn't the Biggest Hurdle</h2>
            <p>Surprisingly, the actual programming part—writing HTML, CSS, maybe some JavaScript—isn't the hardest
                hurdle.
                There
                are tons of tutorials out there, and modern design tools are getting closer to how you'd style
                components in
                code.
                On YouTube, you can find loads of tutorials, and if you prefer to read, there are some great blogs and
                reference
                sites like [<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a>.</p>
            <p>The first real challenge is figuring out the tools. If you're a UX designer today, you're probably
                spending
                most
                of
                your time in Figma. As you move more towards engineering, you'll need to get used to new tools.</p>
            <p>Setting up an IDE like VS Code with some plug-ins doesn’t take long but is very different from Figma.
                Then
                there's
                the whole environment setup and getting your head around version control systems like Git, where you'll
                have
                to
                type
                cryptic commands into a terminal just to get things running. For someone who's never touched the command
                line,
                that
                can be pretty intimidating. Especially for designers who haven't worked with version handling beyond
                naming
                files
                "final_design_v3_final.psd."</p>

            <h2>How Things Work in the Real World</h2>
            <p>Next up is learning how things are done "in the real world." Even if you've studied hard and done a lot
                of
                personal
                projects, when you get to an enterprise environment, things are often done differently.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p style="font-weight: 100;">Say you’re a new web developer on the job, and you’re given a ticket to
                    have a button open an
                    informational
                    popup for
                    users to read for extra information. You have a solid grasp of the fundamentals, so you make a Pull
                    Request
                    where
                    you
                    implement this <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/blog/popover-api-is-here/)">as a
                        popover</a>(e.g.'<code>&lt;div id="extra-information"
        popover&gt;Extra information.&lt;/div&gt;</code>`).
                    <br><br>
                    Then the feedback arrives: … but that’s not how it’s done <span
                        style="font-style: italic;">here</span>…
                    <br><br>
                    At this job, with this current code base, you:
                    <br>
                    1. Use the existing `
                    <code>&lt;Popup /&gt;</code>` element from the Design System.<br>
                    2. Keep the content in the `Copy` package as HTML strings, so it can be translated.<br>
                    3. Make an enum for it (e.g. `export const POPOVER_EXTRA_INFORMATION = "POPOVER_EXTRA_INFORMATION"`)
                    so
                    that
                    anywhere
                    that refers to this component or copy has a consistent name.<br>
                    4. Has a component test ensuring it functions correctly.<br>
                    5. Use special classes from the design system in order to create variations, rather than it’s own
                    bespoke
                    styles.<br><br>

                    None of those things are really “fundamentals”, they are _conventions_ that this particular code
                    base
                    has
                    grown

            <p>These conventions won’t be in coding courses. Writing tests, code reviews, and engineering processes are
                areas
                where
                designers might struggle.</p>
            <p>This is an area where there’s surprisingly little information out there. I’m guessing it's the kind of
                trade
                knowledge that people just learn and don’t feel the need to describe. The best resource I’ve found are
                videos
                from
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevCody">webdevcody</a>.

            <h2>The Biggest Hurdles Are Organizational</h2>
            <p>Honestly, the biggest challenges are organizational. You'll probably need to convince IT to give you
                admin
                access
                to
                install new programs. Getting access to repositories on GitHub or wherever means talking to the DevOps
                team
                or
                an
                engineering manager.</p>
            <p>You'll also need support from your manager to grow into this kind of role. They might not fully
                understand
                what
                you're trying to do, but their backing is crucial. You’ll also need guidance from someone in
                engineering,
                which
                might slow things down as you learn on the job. Remember, you're essentially taking on a junior or
                intern
                dev
                role
                in addition to your designer role.</p>
            <p>If you're part of the design team but doing engineering work, you might end up out of sync with both
                sides.
                You
                could
                find yourself attending more meetings, trying to stay updated with both departments.</p>
            <p>When performance review time comes around, things can get even trickier. How will your manager assess
                your
                performance? If you don’t fit neatly into the usual job descriptions or leveling guides, it might be
                hard
                for
                them
                to justify a raise or promotion, even if you’ve made significant contributions. My only advice is to
                keep
                track
                of
                what you’re doing and show how things would have been missed if you weren’t there to catch them.</p>

            <h2>Is it easier for Engineers to move toward Design?</h2>
            <p>On the flip side, if an engineer wants to move toward design, it might be a bit easier. They can expand
                design
                specifications while still closing tickets. They don’t need access to new tools and will still fit into
                the
                usual
                engineering org. They might take longer to finish tasks because they’re spending more time on design,
                but
                that’s
                a
                similar challenge designers face when they start coding.</p>
            <p>One thing I’ve noticed is that learning resources for design aren’t as comprehensive as those for coding.
                They
                often
                focus on how to use tools rather than teaching design principles. It’s tough to find resources that
                delve
                into
                topics like advanced typography beyond the basics.</p>

            <h2>What to think about for Designers</h2>
            <p>If you're a designer wanting to become a design engineer, your best bet might be working freelance or at
                a
                smaller
                company. Startups are probably ideal since you'd need to help out with a variety of tasks anyway.</p>
            <p>A design engineering role, like any hybrid role, works best if you already have trouble fitting into a
                mold.
                If
                you’ve been working for a while as a designer, it can feel like starting over. You’ll need to augment
                the
                skills
                you
                already have to stand out. </p>
            <p>Focus on areas where you can outperform a full-stack engineer. It could be animation, clever ways to
                handle
                design
                tokens, typography, or micro-adjustments to layout. Use your design eye to add final touches that make a
                difference.

            <h2>Transitioning to Design Engineering is hard but possible</h2>
            <p>Making the transition from design to design engineering is challenging but definitely possible. It helps
                to
                be in
                an
                environment that supports your growth and understands the value you bring. Having managers and
                colleagues

                you up can make a huge difference.</p>
