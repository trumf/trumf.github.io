      <h2>Jakob Nielsen and an "Urgency around AI"</h2>


      <p>Jacob Nielsen wrote <a href="https://jakobnielsenphd.substack.com/p/ux-needs-a-sense-of-urgency-about">
          a blog post</a> that said that designers needs to have urgency about AI. When I first read this article
        I was in the process of being let go from my job, and many of my design friends, were at least being threatened
        of
        loosing their jobs. Nielsen writes that designers need to learn AI but he doesn’t say anything about what that
        would
        mean. It left me with a vague anxiety and stress and it’s first now that I feel like I have the energy to
        address
        it.</p>

      <h2>How do you use AI as a designer?</h2>


      <p>When you search “Design and AI”, you will come across a lot of articles that describe how AI have helped
        designers build
        new apps</p>

      <p>In <a href="https://uxplanet.org/how-i-use-chatgpt-as-a-ui-ux-designer-bcf22b3cb1c0">
          this article</a>, they lay out how they created both the product design roadmap, and the most important
        features
        of the
        product. They used ChatGPT to generate the site map and break down each screen and what needed. They even use AI
        to
        generate code</p>

      <p>In <a href="https://uxplanet.org/is-it-possible-to-create-an-entire-mobile-app-using-chatgpt-aa6000c357a8">
          this article</a>, they talk about how they use AI image generators like Midjourney, Dall-e, and stable
        diffusion
        to
        mockup
        web design ideas. They also talk about how LLM can be useful for research, both preparing questions, analysing
        data and
        querying data afterwards. They also used it for copywriting and to make initial personas for their app.</p>

      <p>In <a href="https://medium.com/@ladzies/combining-ai-and-design-a-step-by-step-guide-467672926f15">
          this article</a>, they use AI for pretty much everything that they need. They can use AI for to create
        personas,
        for
        competitive analysis, for transcript, transcribing, user interviews and surveys as well as AI image generators
        for
        moodboards.</p>

      <span>When I read through these articles and others like them the theme that I see is that AI is used for the
        first
        steps of
        explorations.</span>

      <p>If they generate a moodboard or a picture for the hero section they still needed to move the Photoshop to
        actually
        finish it. When they make a persona they needed to fill-in real data. It seems like right now that the use case
        for AI
        is to speed out up the initial sketching phase and to make something quick to get going, the final touches still
        needs
        to be done by skillfull hand.</p>

      <h2>What does it mean to learn AI</h2>

      <p>So if this is how AI is being used, what kind of skills do you need to do this? <a
          href="https://speckyboy.com/grumpy-designer-ponders-what-it-means-to-learn-ai/">Grumpy designer who wonders
          In this article</a> the Grumpy Designer talks about the skill
        of prompt engineering, and that designers might be especially suited at it because it requires a lot of
        communication
        skills that designers are supposedly great. One point, and I agree with this, is that right now Prompt
        engineering
        is
        very important. You need to learn each model behaves and the magic works to get it to do what you want.</p>

      <p>But as the field matures this is one of the pain points that the model owners will try to fix as quickly as
        possible. So
        in the near future being good at prompt engineering is probably really good but I don’t see it as a sustainable
        skill.
        It’s also not a very transferable skill. Although you can learn some basic guideliens that applies for all you
        will need
        to learn specific prompt structures for each model or service.</p>

      <span>Prompt engineering will not lead to job security.</span>

      <p>They also bring up that API building API on these models will be the best way and this I think is very
        interesting. I do
        see a lot of potential in billing new services if you understand a AI model and the API but it’s usually not
        what
        you
        would consider the core skill of a designer , it either wears into a developer roll. If you want to do the code
        that
        connects this API, or it wears into a more product role for designer, they will need to shift their skill set
        and
        abandon their traditionally traditional key areas to take advantage of this like typography color Composition
      </p>

      <p>The last advice I gave is that the sign should just start using all these and we saw in the earlier segment
        here
        on the
        other post how you might do that so here I think that you will need to learn how to incorporate them, but as the
        field
        progresses, like this is not also not sustainable knowledge, knowing a model right now will not be the same in a
        year
        from now so if you start using another model for some other task for two months and come back your you’re gonna
        need to
        re-up your skill it’s a very short expiry date on this knowledge</p>

      <h2>So what is the designer to do?</h2>

      <p>If you listen to some people, especially people on X/Twitter, it sounds like AI will replace everything. The
        complete job.
        But if you read about how designers are using AI it is more like AI is taking over tasks, or even phases of
        tasks.
        I think it is useful to remember that a job requires a lot of different skills to be able to do a lot of
        different
        tasks</p>

      <p>The article from the grumpy designer and this Forbes article says that you might want to cultivate is the
        skills
        of interpersonal connection and
        communication.
        In my experience as you move from a junior position to more senior position, you move from
        concrete hard skills into fussy soft skills as a manager or lead design of some sort. As a senior you will
        probably do a lot more
        meetings and more talking rather than pen to paper. Are we essentially telling all designers to move
        into a leadership role?</p>

      <p>A more practical issue is that, in my experience, we're not great at hiring for soft skills. There’s no
        leetcodes for soft skills.</p>

      <h2>To sum up</h2>



      <p>Becoming good at a certain AI service, or prompt engineering, will not
        help with long term job security. Learning how to build applications, becoming a developer, seems more
        long term but then you are abandoning your core competencies as a designer.</p>

      <p>Either AI will have minimal effect on the designer profession since you will need someone who has taste and can
        do the
        final touch ups.
        Maybe the only change will be that there are fewer jobs available since people will feel like
        the AI output is good enough.</p>

      <p>If there are fewer jobs available, a contraction, then it would make sense to pivot to
        something where you feel like you have a head start and can switch easily. The alternative is to double down and
        become
        the one who can take a mediocre ai output and make it great.
      </p>

      <p>I suppose that to move with the times and play around with AI is not bad advice in itself. But even when I do
        that
        the urgency is still there.</p>
