            <p>I’ve been confused about why we have seen hardware AI products pop up. Earlier this year there was quite
                a
                lot of
                buzz around the <a href="https://www.rabbit.tech/rabbit-r1">Rabbit r1</a>. The fun design from teenage
                engineering together with hitting the peak of the AI
                hype
                made
                me interested. Even though I wasn’t super excited about buying it or really understood what it was for I
                wanted
                to
                know more. </p>
            <p>The <a href="https://humane.com/aipin">AI pin</a> was another product that was insanely hyped at the
                beginning of the year. It’s a small device
                that you
                can attach to your shirt. It functions as an assistant who can help you remember things, put things in
                the
                calendar,
                buy
                things. </p>
            <div class="responsive-video">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TitZV6k8zfA?si=gCgmw7z0EZKPzYFb" frameborder="0"

            </div>

            <p>The AI pin blew up in a spectacular way with a review from Markus. It even started a discourse about if
                the reviewers have a responsibility to not make to harsh a review since it can kill a company before
                they even get
                started.
                (My
                worry is that reviewers get even more gagged than they already are. They should be critical and guide
                consumers
                to
                good purchases. The critique came mostly from, by what I saw, the type of tech optimist that I mostly
                see on
                twitter. If a company don’t think the product is ready then they should hold the release until it is.
                And
                trust
                me I
                know that is a hard decision to make but I they don’t they shouldn’t be surprised when their stock
                tanks.).
                The
                Rabbit was less dramatic but it didn’t escape harsh reviews and also got a lot of flack when it came to
                light
                that
                the people behind it were <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/rabbit-holed/">NFT and crypto
                    grifters</a> that had pivoted to AI last year.
            </p>
            <p>Both these events left me thinking “Why?”. And there were so many why’s: Why did they decide to build a
                Hardware
                product in the first place? Why did they decide to release them when they were so underperforming? Why
                did
                so
                many
                people think it was such a good idea? Why are we so excited for “assistants”?</p>

        <div class="section_content paragraph-wrapper ">
            <h2 class="headM">Why hardware?</h2>
            <p>There is a really <a href="https://x.com/jaykapoor24/status/1785940555471659429?s=12">funny clip</a> from
                one reviewer of the rabbit where they talk about how they would
                redesign it.
                First
                they would remove the jockey wheel, then they would make it smaller with the edge all he way to the
                screen… by
                the
                end they have a smartphone with a rabbit logo. I was thinking the same thing. I wondered: If the selling
                point
                is
                the “assistant” functionality, which is all software, why go through the effort of making a hardware
                thing? Why
                not
                spend the time and money on building up the assistant capability which is not an easy thing to do and
                something
                they
                didn’t manage to take care of?</p>


            <p>My half baked ideas for why:</p>
            <p>Maybe they were hoping to make back some investment by the selling the hardware. They would sell the
                hardware
                with
                enough margin to give them cashflow while they continued building the software. The AI pin needs a
                subscription
                to
                work but the rabbit was sold as is with no mention of a subscription. I don’t know what their plan was
                since it
                seems like it would be hard to maintain growth (because lets be clear that these companies where built
                on the
                Silicon Valley model of funding that require exponential growth. Or maybe the rabbit wasn’t, I’ve no
                idea what
                their
                business plan looks like, but I wonder where they got the funding from if it wants this model) by
                selling a 200$
                gadget. </p>
            <p>The second reason I can think of is that they wanted to build some kind of a moat. With Google, OpenAI,
                Meta, as
                well
                as newer companies like Hugging Face and Anthropic all building foundational models and the
                infrastructure to
                build
                solutions on top of them (like GPTs, Agents, RAGs) it will be hard to compete. You can try to build an
                assistant,
                which is close to the standard chat interface of these models, and fight against some of the biggest
                companies
                in
                the world to create a better product. Or maybe you build a hardware gadget that can be used to access
                these
                models.
                Maybe the form factor of your hardware is so nice to use that customers stay with your gadget and pay to
                allow
                their
                assistant to be housed in it… Was that the bet? <a
                    href="https://interconnected.org/home/2024/01/26/hardware">Its really hard to build a product
                    category</a>.</p>
            <p>Maybe the simple reason is that it is much easier to sell a device to an end customer than a
                subscription? People
                are
                reluctant to pay for software and it is much easer to sell B2B solutions. But a device might make people
                open
                their
                wallet? Maybe this is not Spotify, it is a vinyl record that you can hold and display and show your
                friends?</p>

            <h2 class="headM">What’s up with assistants?</h2>
            <p>I mean, I get it. I have a bunch of things I would like to get done and it would be great if someone
                could them for me. The thing is that most of the things I personally want to get done you need a body to
                do. I need to do the
                dishes and put away the laundry, the living room could use some tidying up. At most an AI assistant can
                assist
                me by making a TODO list. </p>
            <p>What about the things you do online? I’m not happy about letting my browser know my location, handing
                over my
                login
                information to companies that recently was deeply involved with crypto seems like a bad idea. I don’t
                think they
                have my best interest in mind. Since I struggle to make it through buying a plane ticket without adding
                extra
                costs
                you might understand why I wouldn't want an AI to pay my bills in 2024. I require a lot more hands on
                control.
                Did
                we, collectively, think that the AIs would be so good during this year that we would be happy to let
                them handle
                our
                online accounts? </p>
            <p>There are quite a few companies that have started selling automated messages for social media accounts.
                But that
                is
                mostly for business accounts or a personal account that is run like a business. The type of account
                where you
                need
                to post several times a day to stay relevant. It’s very different from the personal, private, assistant
                that the
                AI
                pin and Rabbit R1 claim to be. </p>

            <p>The reason I started writing this post was because I read this blog about <a
                    href="https://fasterandworse.com/complicated-sticks/">“Complicated Sticks”</a>. The
                theses is that
                these hardware assistants are a type of complicated stick. You could potentially do anything with a
                stick. The
                potential is the attractive part. You are buying the potential to have a magic stick that can help you
                book a
                trip, not the actual ability to do it. </p>

                <p style="font-weight: light; font-style: oblique;
    line-height: 160%;">"This is the trend of making what I call complicated
                    sticks. Complicated
                    sticks are complex tech
                    products that are
                    useful for everything and nothing in particular. Evident in these wispy ads that try to give a
                    blanket
                    impression of
                    good vibes and positivity that’s more suited to fashion, fragrances, and marketing within flooded
                    product
                    categories, not supposedly innovative tech that helps us do things we couldn’t do before."</p>

            </div>
            <p>When thinking about this topic I keep returning to the concept of <a
                    href="/posts/AIbluntsharpend.html">blunt and sharp end</a> I wrote about a
                while ago. I
                find it very helpful to categorize the products (or really the rhetoric surrounding the products) into
                blunt and
                sharp end. A sharp end product is something that helps an expert to get marginally better. It addresses
                a concrete
                use-case or pain point that a person skilled in that domain have. From the blunt end you dont have
                visibility of
                what their jobs even is, complicated sticks sounds like a good idea. When we consider an AI hardware
                assistant I
                think we are operating in a blunt end mode.</p>
            <p>Hardware AI products leave baffled. I’m really not sure what happened and what we can learn from this. I
                mostly have
                questions.</p>
