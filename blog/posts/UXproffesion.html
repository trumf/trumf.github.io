            <p> When I first learnt about ux design it was a role that did everything. Your job was to do research, make
                wireframes,
                hold workshops, make pixel perfect designs. It was a role where you needed to be able to talk with
                business
                people in
                business way, engineers in an engineering way, and with other designers. To me it seemed like daunting
                amount of skills
                you had to master</p>

            <p>When I actually started working i saw that the research role and the designer role was often split. It
                makes
                sense to
                me. Both of these roles takes a long time to become good at and they also the tasks for each role
                require a
                lot of time.</p>


            <p>As time went on I saw more and more roles become popular. You had UX writers and then soon after that you
                had
                content
                designers. Graphical designers first became UI designers, then UX /UI designers and then maybe they
                started
                doing motion
                design when the big platforms started pushing video. And of course the design system designer.</p>

            <p>As tech grew bigger and bigger there were more roles to fill. At big tech there were opportunities to
                niche
                yourself so
                you were both employable and able to focus on the of work that you enjoyed the most.</p>

            <p>Today people are getting laid off left and right and the niches are disappearing. When your company
                suddenly
                need to
                “down-size” specialized roles are often the first to go.</p>

            <span>I want to understand what niches might stick around but first we need to take a look backwards.</span>

            <h2>Were there as many niched roles before the dotcom crash?</h2>



            <p>It seems to me that thee were a couple of strands that ended up being lumped into the UX designer role.
            </p>

            <p>The first strand come from the marketing agencies. In the 90s the internet exploded and the people who
                had
                previously
                done print design, graphic designers, suddenly got a new medium to work in. Over time we have seen a
                constant exchange,
                both ways, between marketing agencies and big tech. Graphic designers have today become (in many
                instances)
                brand
                designers. We have also added motion designers to this mix.</p>

            <p>Another strand we see from 80s marketing agencies are copy writers. Copy writers have branched out into
                UX
                writing and
                then content designers.</p>

            <p>The second big influence comes from engineering. If you were a programmer with a knack for figuring out
                edge
                cases on
                the front end you might start to call yourself Interaction designer. We also get a big influx from the
                ergonomics.
                Early usability material uses a lot of similar methods as ergonomics.</p>

        <div class="section_content paragraph-wrapper">
            <p>The third one is researchers. Often from behavioral science. Interviews and and observations are staple
                methods in
                research. It’s not surprising that academics wanted to see what it was like outside of the university
                and
                design
                was a good place to go. We are mostly talking about qualitative researches, maybe a few who are
                good at surveys. When i was going through textbooks about research for design it was mostly qualitative
                methods.
                Sometimes more quantitative methods were used but since the number of participants generally low and
                descriptive
                statistics was enough. I’ve never read anything about how qualitative research was/is used in marketing
                agencies but if
                you have any suggestions please let me know.</p>

            <p>The last strand I’ve seen is from the “consultant” industry. By that I mean IDEO and the ideas they
                promoted.
                A while
                ago it struck me that IDEO never talks to designers, they are always talking to mangers and directors
                without a design
                background. I can’t identify a particular role that comes from this influence but they have given us a
                lot
                of
                ideas and ideological baggage. I’m thinking of the workshop methods and of course the design thinking
                courses. There are
                more agancies than IDEO of course but I feel they exemplify this kind of influence.</p>

            <p>I think I need to stop here for the sake of time and come back to the more current roles in design. As I
                said
                in the
                beginning I don’t have any sources for this and I’m more trying to describe a vibe than actual facts.
            </p>

            <p>If you were around for the dotcom crash i would love to hear how things looked before and after and if
                you
                have seen the
                same influences that i have.</p>
