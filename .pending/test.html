<div style="padding: 20%;">
    <p>Explanation
        Container Padding: The .container class has padding set to 20px. The box-sizing: border-box property ensures
        that
        the
        padding is included in the total width and height of the container, so the padding will always be respected.

        Responsive Inner Divs: The .inner-div class has a width of 100% by default, ensuring it scales with the
        container.
        The
        box-sizing: border-box property ensures any padding or border added to the inner divs does not increase their
        width
        beyond the container.

        Media Query for Larger Screens: When the viewport width is at least 600px, the .inner-div class changes its
        width to
        48%, allowing two inner divs to sit side by side with a margin in between them. The last inner div has its
        margin
        removed to avoid overflow.

        By using this approach, the inner divs will respect the container's padding and adjust their size responsively
        as
        the
        viewport changes.</p>
