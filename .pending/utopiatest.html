                <p>Many artists struggle to generate a consistent source of income, often waiting months or even years
                    to receive royalties for their music. Our product offers a solution to this problem by providing a
                    way for artists to receive their royalties quicker. As the designer of this product, my task was to
                    redesign an existing app and create a seamless and enjoyable user experience for artists. It was
                    important to me that the product be both trustworthy and safe for artists to use, as well as
                    attractive to our B2B customers.</p>

                <p>To identify our target audience, we conducted a workshop with representatives from different teams
                    including product, engineering, customer operations, and data science. We identified five key user
                    groups, two on the B2B partner side (developers who valued ease of use and documentation, and
                    business owners focused on ROI) and three on the consumer side (emerging creators, established
                    creators, and artist managers). We decided to focus on emerging and established artists for the
                    first version of our product. After an audit of our product, we found that our existing app had some
                    shortcomings, such as lengthy process and requiring multiple devices and channels to complete the
                    process.</p>

            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>The redesign process began with a workshop where we took our time to map out the software
                    architecture and decide on where we could improve the users experience through third party services.

            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>We broke down the design work into functional areas, focusing on each specific purpose of the
                    process. By doing this, we were able to develop each area for a first draft, which gave us a good
                    sense of how everything was coming together.</p>

            <div class="paragraph text-image">
                <p>The design started with identifying the components needed for each stage and initial sketching of
                    ideas. We then fleshed out these ideas into mockup screens that had most of the necessary
                    components. This helped us to visualise the app and ensure that we were on the right track. To make
                    the app easy to use on any device, we tested the mockups on different device sizes. This helped us
                    to spot any issues with the responsive design and make adjustments as needed.</p>

            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>The draft design used an old version of the design system. Half way through the draft process the
                    company
                    moved to a new brand design. The new brand guidelines lacked UI direction, so we explored variations
                    to
                    incorporate the brand within the app.</p>

                <p>The old design system was soft and round with heavy use of the primary brand color and no dark mode.
                    The
                    new brand guidelines emphasized heavy imagery, distorted type, and hard angles. We started with
                    incorporating the new imagery and bold colors, but quickly ruled out distorted type as it was not
                    suitable for the app.</p>

                    toned it down, keeping some of the brand imagery, and after a third round of revisions, we settled
                    on a
                    design that aligned with other products in the Utopia Music Portfolio.</p>
